          We assume that you agree to our terms and conditions when placing an
          order. Once an order is placed, we do not offer any cancellation,
          exchange, or returns.

          However, for any products requiring possible alterations, we will be

          Our packaging is done just as carefully as the quality of the products
          they contain. Our team ensures that all products are released in
          perfect condition from our end.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if there's a genuine defect or damage in the received product
          caused in transit, a replacement will be offered only if there's an
          uncut unpacking video within 24 hours of receiving it. The video should
          contain the sealed packet with the printed shipment label proof. The
          product returned should contain original tags and packaging in an
          unworn/unused state.
        </p>
        <p>
          On receipt of the returned product, our team will conduct a quality
          check and proceed to ship the replacement or refund. The store reserves
          the right to refuse a return if the product is found to be used and
          worn upon its arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that the entire process of replacement or refund may take
          up to 12-15 days. Your cooperation and patience during the same will be
          highly valued.
